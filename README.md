# F7-TWING-
The SucceX-D Mini F7 is designed to work seamlessly with DJI’s new HD FPV system. To make things even simpler, the DJI Air unit can just be plugged into the FC with the included wire harness. In addition, we added the popular and reliable USB Type-C instead of Micro USB and therefore the same standard than your DJI module.
 
But the real magic of this flight controller lies in its TWIN GYRO configuration.
 
The TwinG uses two identical gyros oriented side by side with one offset 90 degrees from the other. Betaflight uses GYRO FUSION to blend and average the information from both gyros to send a much cleaner signal to the PID loop controller! Less noise and fewer oscillations across the throttle band without adding any delay! Betaflight software filters can be lowered in most cases as well, which brings a significant decrease in delay.
 
With plenty of processing power and UARTS, this is also the perfect flight controller for long-range GPS builds. And the TwinG configuration makes it the perfect FC for builds like macro quads, cinematic filming rigs and x-class racers that are a bit trickier to tune.
